# Small Coded Projects
The projects here are small Python Coded projects:

**1. Rolling a dice:**
This project is a simple game that randomly rolls a dice every time and gives you the number that probably appeared on that device. 

**2. Guessing a number** 
This code is a number guesing game that asks you to guess a number between 1 and 20, while giving you 4 guesses to do so. 

**3. Mad-lib story** 
This is an actual mad-lib game, where you will be asked to give some nouns or adjectives as prompted and it would be stored in a 
pre-made story that would be displayed in the end. 

**4. Hangman** 
An actual hangman game, without hanging the man. You are asked to guess letters that ultimately leads to an entire word. You get only 4 guesses though.
